### Problem 2
- Create a profile picture with a notification badge using Box.
- Align the badge to the bottom-end corner using Modifier.align().
- Add a toggle button to show/hide the badge (you may choose your badge)

This repo uses several composable functions to create a state-controlled node that may show/hide the badge on the bottom end corner of the profile picture.
